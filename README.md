## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weronika3861/project-management.git
cd project-management
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Configure the Environment

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and update the following database configuration to match your local MySQL setup:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=project_management
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
```

If you're using a different MySQL setup, adjust these values accordingly.

### 4. Generate Application Key

Generate the Laravel application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Migrate the Database

Run the migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the necessary tables.

### 6. Create Fake Users for Testing

To generate some test users for the application, you can use **Faker**. Run the following command:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

This will create sample users that you can use for testing the application.


### 7. Serve the Application

You can now serve the application locally using the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application should be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.

To log in to the application, you can use the following credentials generated by Faker:

- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Password: `password`
